# Launching Erebus

Today marks the launch of **Erebus**, our new platform for real-time infrastructure at the edge.  
The web is moving faster than ever — apps are no longer static, users expect instant updates, and developers need tools that scale without friction. Erebus is built to make that shift simple.

## Why Erebus?

We built Erebus because existing real-time solutions felt fragmented, complex, or stuck in old paradigms. Developers needed something modern, lightweight, and developer-first. Erebus is our answer: a platform where you can spin up secure, low-latency channels with just a few lines of code.

## What Makes It Different

Erebus isn’t just another messaging layer. It’s designed around the edge:

- **Cloudflare Durable Objects** for stateful, distributed infrastructure  
- **Next.js SDK** with typed hooks for an intuitive developer experience  
- **Convex backend** for managing projects, usage, and access seamlessly  
- **ULID-based ordering** for predictable and region-aware message sequencing  

## Getting Started

The first release of Erebus focuses on what developers need most:  
a reliable, real-time channel system you can drop directly into your app.  

Our SDK is live on npm (`erebus-core-react`), and the console is open for signups. More features — from advanced monitoring to global ordering options — are coming soon.

This is just the beginning. Erebus is our foundation for the future of real-time at the edge. We’re excited to share more in the weeks ahead.
