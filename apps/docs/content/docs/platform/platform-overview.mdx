# Platform Overview

The Erebus platform is your complete real-time infrastructure solution built for the edge. It provides WebSocket-based pub/sub messaging, presence tracking, and analytics with global distribution through Cloudflare's network.

## What is the Erebus Platform?

The Erebus platform consists of several integrated components that work together to provide a seamless real-time infrastructure experience:

### Core Infrastructure
- **Edge-First Architecture**: Built on Cloudflare Durable Objects for global distribution
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: High-performance real-time messaging with guaranteed ordering
- **Serverless by Design**: Pay only for what you use with automatic scaling to zero

### Platform Features

#### Project Management
- **Multi-Project Organization**: Organize your applications into separate projects (up to 50 projects per account)
- **Regional Deployment**: Choose between Global (auto-region) and EU-specific deployment
- **Project Settings**: Configure webhooks, naming, and other project-specific options

#### API Key Management
- **Environment Separation**: Separate development and production API keys for security
- **Key States**: Active, disabled, and revoked states for granular access control
- **Security Features**: Built-in key rotation and usage monitoring

#### Real-Time Analytics
- **Connection Metrics**: Track WebSocket connections, subscriptions, and message volume
- **Time-Range Analysis**: View metrics by hour or day with flexible date ranges
- **Performance Monitoring**: Identify peak usage and optimize accordingly

#### Audit Logging
- **Complete Activity Tracking**: Every API key creation, project change, and setting modification is logged
- **Security Compliance**: Detailed audit trails for regulatory compliance and security monitoring
- **Recent History**: Access to the 100 most recent audit events per project

## Architecture Overview

### Built on Cloudflare Durable Objects

Erebus leverages Cloudflare's Durable Objects technology to provide:

- **Global Distribution**: 300+ edge locations worldwide
- **Consistent State**: Stateful objects that maintain consistency without global coordination
- **Automatic Scaling**: Scale to zero when idle, instantly scale up under load
- **Low Latency**: Users connect to the nearest point of presence

### How It Works

1. **Client Connection**: Your application connects to the nearest Cloudflare edge location
2. **Durable Object Routing**: Connections are routed to the appropriate Durable Object based on channel names
3. **State Management**: Each Durable Object maintains consistent state for its channels
4. **Message Ordering**: ULID-based sequencing ensures message ordering within channels
5. **Presence Tracking**: Automatic presence updates when clients join/leave channels

## Platform Capabilities

### Real-Time Messaging
- **Pub/Sub Channels**: Publish and subscribe to named channels with guaranteed message ordering
- **Quality of Service**: QoS 1 support with acknowledgments for reliable delivery
- **Message History**: Access to recent message history for catching up on missed events

### Presence System
- **Automatic Tracking**: Know who's online in each channel without additional setup
- **Real-Time Updates**: Instant presence notifications when users join or leave
- **Metadata Support**: Attach custom data to presence events

### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript-First**: Full type safety with comprehensive TypeScript support
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Node.js, and any JavaScript runtime
- **Rich SDKs**: Purpose-built SDKs for different use cases and frameworks

## Platform Limits and Quotas

### Project Limits
- **Maximum Projects**: 50 projects per account
- **API Keys**: Unlimited API keys per project
- **Regions**: Global (auto-region) and EU available

### Audit Logs
- **Retention**: 100 most recent audit events per project
- **Real-Time**: Audit events appear immediately after actions

### Performance
- **Concurrent Connections**: No hard limits (scales with your usage plan)
- **Message Rate**: Optimized for high-throughput applications
- **Channel Limits**: No restrictions on channel names or count
