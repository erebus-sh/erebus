# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Erebus platform. You can generate API keys in the Erebus dashboard.

## How to use API keys

API keys are the gateway to your project. They are used to authenticate requests and determine billing and access.

How to start using your API keys:

1. Open your project in the Erebus dashboard
2. Go to the API Keys section
3. Click on the "Create API Key" button
4. Enter a name for your API key
5. Choose Development or Production (Currently, there is no performance or literal difference between development and production environments. This separation exists for security best practices and key organization purposes only.)
6. Click on the "Create" button
7. Copy the API key
8. Use the API key in your code

## API Key Format

API keys are in the format of `sk-er-<random-string>` for production and `dv-er-<random-string>` for development.
