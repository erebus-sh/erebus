# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Erebus platform. They provide secure access to your real-time infrastructure and enable you to build applications that connect to Erebus services.

<Callout title="Advanced Features" type="info">
This guide covers the basics of API keys. For comprehensive key management, security practices, and advanced features, see our [API Key Management Guide](/docs/platform/api-key-management).
</Callout>

## What are API Keys?

API keys serve as the primary authentication mechanism for accessing Erebus platform services. Each key:

- **Authenticates** your application when connecting to Erebus
- **Authorizes** access to specific project resources
- **Tracks** usage for billing and analytics
- **Provides** audit trail for security and compliance

## How to use API keys

API keys are the gateway to your project. They are used to authenticate requests and determine billing and access.

### Creating Your First API Key

1. **Open your project** in the Erebus dashboard
2. **Navigate to API Keys** section in the project sidebar
3. **Click "Create new key"** button
4. **Enter a descriptive name** for your API key (e.g., "Development Frontend")
5. **Choose Environment Type**:
   - **Development** (`dv-er-*`): For testing and development
   - **Production** (`sk-er-*`): For live applications
6. **Click "Create Key"** to generate the new API key
7. **Copy the API key immediately** (you won't see the full key again)
8. **Store securely** in environment variables or secrets management

<Callout title="Environment Types" type="note">
Currently, there is no performance or literal difference between development and production environments. This separation exists for security best practices and key organization purposes only.
</Callout>

### Using API Keys in Your Code

Store API keys securely and use them to authenticate your Erebus connections:

```typescript
// Store in environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.EREBUS_API_KEY;

// Use in your authentication server
const token = jwt.sign({
  sub: 'user-123',
  erebus_api_key: apiKey
}, 'your-jwt-secret');
```

## API Key Format

API keys follow a specific format to indicate their environment and purpose:

- **Production**: `sk-er-<random-string>`
- **Development**: `dv-er-<random-string>`

The prefix clearly identifies the key type and helps prevent accidentally using development keys in production environments.

## Key States and Management

API keys have different states that control their functionality:

### Key States

**Active**
- ✅ Full functionality and access
- Default state for newly created keys
- Ready for production use

**Disabled**
- ⏸️ Temporarily suspended functionality
- Can be re-enabled without creating a new key
- Useful for debugging or maintenance

**Revoked**
- ❌ Permanently disabled and cannot be reactivated
- Used when keys are compromised or no longer needed
- Irreversible action with audit trail

### Basic Key Operations

**Enable/Disable Keys**
- Temporarily suspend key functionality without permanent removal
- Useful during maintenance or debugging
- Can be reversed at any time

**Revoke Keys**
- Permanently disable compromised or unused keys
- Cannot be undone - requires creating new keys
- All revocation actions are logged in audit trails

**Update Key Information**
- Change descriptive labels and metadata
- Update key settings and configuration
- Track changes through audit logs

## Security Best Practices

### Basic Security

- **Environment Variables**: Never hard-code API keys in source code
- **Secure Storage**: Use dedicated secrets management in production
- **Access Control**: Limit who can view and manage API keys
- **Regular Review**: Periodically audit active keys and revoke unused ones

### Key Organization

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear labels that indicate purpose and environment
- **Environment Separation**: Keep development and production keys separate
- **Service-Specific Keys**: Consider separate keys for different services
- **Regular Rotation**: Plan for periodic key rotation, especially in production

## Getting Started

Ready to start using API keys? Follow these next steps:

1. **[Platform Getting Started](/docs/platform/getting-started)** - Complete setup walkthrough
2. **[SDK Documentation](/docs/sdk)** - Use your API keys with Erebus SDKs
3. **[API Key Management](/docs/platform/api-key-management)** - Advanced key management features
4. **[Security Best Practices](/docs/platform/api-key-management#security-management)** - Comprehensive security guide

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures**
- Verify the API key is active (not disabled or revoked)
- Check that the complete key is being used
- Ensure your JWT includes the `erebus_api_key` field

**Key Access Issues**
- Confirm you have access to the correct project
- Check that the key hasn't been revoked
- Verify the key is being used in the correct environment
