# Getting Started with Erebus Platform

This guide will walk you through everything you need to start building real-time applications with Erebus, from creating your account to making your first WebSocket connection.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:
- A GitHub account (required for authentication)
- A modern web browser
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript
- A project where you want to add real-time features

## Step 1: Sign In with GitHub

*[Screenshot placeholder: Sign-in page with GitHub button]*

1. Navigate to [erebus.sh](https://erebus.sh)
2. Click "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Authorize Erebus to access your GitHub account
4. You'll be redirected to the platform dashboard

The Erebus platform uses GitHub OAuth for secure authentication. This ensures we never store your passwords and provides seamless access management.

## Step 2: Choose Your Plan

*[Screenshot placeholder: Pricing page with plan selection]*

After signing in, you'll need to select a subscription plan:

1. Review the available pricing tiers
2. Select the plan that fits your usage needs
3. Complete the subscription process
4. You'll be redirected to create your first project

<Callout title="Free Tier Available" type="note">
Most plans include generous free usage limits, perfect for development and small applications.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Create Your First Project

*[Screenshot placeholder: Create project dialog with form fields]*

Projects organize your real-time applications and provide isolated environments for different use cases.

### Creating the Project

1. Click "Create new project" from your dashboard
2. Enter a descriptive project name (3-100 characters)
3. Choose your deployment region:
   - **Global**: Automatically routes to the closest region (recommended)
   - **EU**: Fixed deployment in European data centers (coming soon)
4. Click "Create Project"

### Project Organization

Each project provides:
- Isolated API keys and authentication
- Separate analytics and monitoring
- Independent audit logs
- Project-specific settings and webhooks

<Callout title="Project Limits" type="info">
You can create up to 50 projects per account. Each project can have unlimited API keys.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Generate Your First API Key

*[Screenshot placeholder: API Keys page with create dialog]*

API keys authenticate your applications and control access to your real-time infrastructure.

### Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to the "API Keys" section in your project
2. Click "Create new key"
3. Enter a descriptive label (e.g., "Development Key")
4. Choose your environment:
   - **Development**: For testing and development work
   - **Production**: For live applications

<Callout title="Environment Types" type="note">
Currently, development and production keys have the same capabilities. The separation exists for organization and security best practices.
</Callout>

### API Key Format

Your API keys follow this format:
- Production: `sk-er-[random-string]`
- Development: `dv-er-[random-string]`

**Important**: Copy your API key immediately after creation. You won't be able to see the full key again for security reasons.

## Step 5: Explore the Project Dashboard

*[Screenshot placeholder: Project dashboard with navigation sidebar]*

Your project dashboard provides access to all platform features:

### Navigation Overview

- **Dashboard**: Analytics overview with connection metrics
- **Usage**: Detailed usage analytics and time-range selection
- **API Keys**: Manage authentication keys and permissions
- **Audit Logs**: Security and activity tracking
- **Settings**: Project configuration and webhooks
- **WebSocket Inspector**: Real-time connection debugging (coming soon)

### Dashboard Metrics

The main dashboard shows:
- Total connections over time
- Message volume and subscription counts
- Peak usage statistics
- Real-time activity graphs

## Step 6: Configure Project Settings

*[Screenshot placeholder: Project settings page with webhook configuration]*

### Basic Settings

1. Navigate to "Settings" in your project
2. Configure your project name and description
3. Set up webhook URLs for message forwarding (optional)

### Webhook Configuration

Webhooks allow you to forward messages to your backend services:

1. Enter a valid HTTPS base URL (e.g., `https://yourapi.com`)
2. The system validates the URL format automatically
3. Messages will be forwarded to `[webhook-url]/erebus/webhook`

<Callout title="Webhook Requirements" type="warning">
Webhook URLs must use HTTPS and be base URLs without paths. The system automatically appends `/erebus/webhook` to your configured URL.
</Callout>

## Step 7: Make Your First Connection

Now let's connect to your Erebus project using the SDK:

### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @erebus-sh/sdk
```

### Basic Connection Example

```typescript
import { ErebusClient, ErebusClientState } from "@erebus-sh/sdk/client";

// Initialize the client
const client = ErebusClient.createClient({
  client: ErebusClientState.PubSub,
  authBaseUrl: "YOUR_AUTH_SERVER_URL" // Your backend auth endpoint
});

// Join a channel (this creates the channel if it doesn't exist)
client.joinChannel("my-first-channel");

// Connect to Erebus
await client.connect();

// Subscribe to messages
await client.subscribe("notifications", (message) => {
  console.log("ðŸ“© Received message:", message.payload);
});

// Publish a test message
await client.publish("notifications", {
  type: "welcome",
  message: "Hello from Erebus! ðŸš€"
});

console.log("âœ… Successfully connected to Erebus!");
```

### Authentication Server Setup

You'll need an authentication endpoint that returns JWT tokens. Here's a minimal Express.js example:

```javascript
// auth-server.js
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const app = express();

app.post('/auth/erebus', (req, res) => {
  // Validate your user here
  const token = jwt.sign(
    {
      sub: 'user-123',
      erebus_api_key: 'your-api-key-here'
    },
    'your-jwt-secret',
    { expiresIn: '1h' }
  );

  res.json({ token });
});

app.listen(3001);
```

<Callout title="Authentication Required" type="info">
Erebus requires JWT tokens for authentication. The token must include your API key in the `erebus_api_key` field. See our [authentication guide](/docs/sdk/core/getting-started-api#authentication) for detailed setup.
</Callout>

## Step 8: Monitor Your Application

*[Screenshot placeholder: Dashboard showing live metrics]*

Once your application is connected:

### Real-Time Monitoring

1. Return to your project dashboard
2. Watch real-time metrics update as you connect and send messages
3. Use the time-range selector to view historical data
4. Monitor connection counts and message volume

### Audit Log Verification

1. Navigate to "Audit Logs"
2. See logged events for API key creation and project changes
3. Use audit logs for security monitoring
