# Audit Logs

Audit logs provide complete visibility into all activities within your Erebus projects. Every significant action is automatically tracked, creating an immutable record for security monitoring, and operational oversight.

## What are Audit Logs?

Audit logs are automatically generated records that capture all meaningful activities in your Erebus projects. They provide a complete trail of:

- **Who** performed the action (actor identification)
- **What** action was performed (create, update, delete)
- **When** it happened (precise timestamps)
- **What** was affected (resource type and ID)
- **Whether** it succeeded or failed (status tracking)
- **Why** it was done (descriptive context)

*[Screenshot placeholder: Audit logs interface showing recent activity]*

## Tracked Activities

### API Key Management
All API key operations are automatically logged:

- **Key Creation**: New API key generation with environment type
- **Key Updates**: Label changes and configuration modifications
- **Key Status Changes**: Enabling, disabling, and revoking keys
- **Key Deletion**: Permanent key removal (when permitted)

### Project Management
Project-level changes are comprehensively tracked:

- **Project Creation**: New project initialization
- **Project Updates**: Name changes and configuration modifications
- **Project Settings**: Webhook URL changes and other settings
- **Project Deletion**: Project removal attempts and restrictions

### System Events
Important system-level activities:

- **Configuration Changes**: Platform setting modifications
- **Error Events**: System errors and their resolution
- **Performance Events**: Significant performance impact events

## Audit Log Structure

Each audit log entry contains the following information:

### Core Fields

**Actor Information**
- **User ID**: Unique identifier of the person who performed the action
- **User Name**: Display name of the actor
- **User Image**: Profile image for visual identification in the interface

**Action Details**
- **Action Type**: `create`, `update`, or `delete`
- **Action Description**: Human-readable summary of what was done
- **Entity Type**: The type of resource affected (e.g., "api_key", "project")
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier of the affected resource

**Timing and Status**
- **Timestamp**: Precise date and time when the action occurred
- **Status**: Boolean indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`)
- **Description**: Detailed human-readable explanation of the event

### Example Audit Log Entry

```json
{
  "id": "01HQXYZ123ABC456DEF789",
  "actorId": "user_01HQXYZ123ABC456",
  "action": "create",
  "actionDescription": "Generated new API key",
  "entityType": "api_key",
  "entityId": "key_01HQXYZ789DEF123ABC456",
  "projectId": "proj_01HQXYZ456ABC789DEF123",
  "description": "Created development API key 'My Dev Key' for project 'My Chat App'",
  "status": true,
  "createdAt": 1699123456789
}
```

## Accessing Audit Logs

### Platform Dashboard

*[Screenshot placeholder: Navigation to audit logs section]*

1. **Navigate to Your Project**: Select the project you want to audit
2. **Open Audit Logs**: Click "Audit Logs" in the project sidebar
3. **View Recent Activity**: See the most recent 100 audit events

### Audit Log Interface

*[Screenshot placeholder: Audit logs list with filters and search]*

The audit log interface provides:

- **Chronological Listing**: Events ordered by most recent first
- **Visual Timeline**: Easy-to-scan activity timeline with user avatars
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Human-readable explanations of each event
- **Status Indicators**: Clear success/failure visual indicators
- **Actor Attribution**: See who performed each action

### Empty State

*[Screenshot placeholder: Empty audit logs state]*

When no audit events exist yet:
- Clean interface explaining what will be tracked
- Links to documentation for understanding audit logs
- Guidance on actions that will generate audit events

## Retention and Limits

### Current Retention Policy

- **Event Count**: 100 most recent audit events per project
- **Time Limit**: No time-based expiration (count-based only)
- **Storage**: Events are permanently retained until displaced by newer events

<Callout title="Retention Policy" type="info">
The system currently retains the 100 most recent audit events per project. Older events are automatically removed as new events are added. Time-based retention policies may be introduced in future updates.
</Callout>

### Event Ordering

- **Chronological Order**: Events are ordered by creation timestamp
- **Real-Time Updates**: New events appear immediately after actions
- **Consistent Numbering**: Each event has a unique identifier for reference

## Security

### Security Monitoring

Audit logs enable comprehensive security oversight:

**Unauthorized Access Detection**
- Monitor for unexpected API key creation or modification
- Track unusual project setting changes
- Identify suspicious authentication patterns

**Access Pattern Analysis**
- Review who is accessing which projects and when
- Identify unusual activity patterns or timing
- Monitor for privilege escalation attempts

**Change Management**
- Track all configuration changes with full attribution
- Maintain accountability for system modifications
- Enable rollback planning with complete change history

## Best Practices

### Regular Review

**Establish Review Schedules**
- **Daily**: Quick scan for any unusual activity
- **Weekly**: Detailed review of all changes and access patterns
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive audit of all activities and trends

**Key Indicators to Monitor**
- Failed authentication attempts
- API key modifications outside business hours
- Unexpected project configuration changes
- High-volume activity patterns

### Security Workflows

**Incident Response**
1. **Initial Detection**: Use audit logs to identify security events
2. **Impact Assessment**: Review all related audit entries
3. **Timeline Construction**: Build chronological sequence of events
4. **Attribution**: Identify all actors involved in the incident

**Preventive Measures**
- Regular audit of API key usage and permissions
- Monitoring for dormant keys that should be revoked
- Verification of project access patterns

### Integration with Security Tools

While Erebus doesn't currently provide audit log export, you can:

**Manual Documentation**
- Screenshot important audit events for records
- Document significant changes in your security log
- Maintain correlation with external security events

**Future Integrations**
- API access for programmatic audit log retrieval (planned)
- SIEM integration capabilities (under consideration)
- Automated alerting for suspicious patterns (roadmap item)

## Interpreting Common Audit Events

### API Key Events

*[Screenshot placeholder: API key audit events with descriptions]*

**"Generated new API key"**
- **Trigger**: User creates a new API key via the dashboard
- **Important Data**: Environment type (dev/prod), key label
- **Security Note**: Monitor for unexpected key generation

**"Revoked API key"**
- **Trigger**: User permanently revokes an API key
- **Important Data**: Which key was revoked and why
- **Security Note**: Verify revocation was intentional

**"Updated API key status"**
- **Trigger**: User enables or disables an API key
- **Important Data**: Status change direction (active/disabled)
- **Security Note**: Monitor for unauthorized status changes

### Project Events

*[Screenshot placeholder: Project audit events with descriptions]*

**"Created new project"**
- **Trigger**: User creates a project via the dashboard
- **Important Data**: Project name and region selection
- **Security Note**: Monitor for unexpected project creation

**"Updated project settings"**
- **Trigger**: User modifies project configuration
- **Important Data**: Which settings were changed
- **Security Note**: Verify webhook URL changes are legitimate

## Troubleshooting Audit Logs

### Missing Events

**Events Not Appearing**
- **Immediate Check**: Refresh the audit logs page
- **Timing**: Some events may have a few seconds delay
- **Permissions**: Verify you have access to the project

**Historical Events Missing**
- **Retention Limit**: Only 100 most recent events are kept
- **Project Scope**: Events are project-specific
- **Time Range**: Check if you're looking at the correct project

### Understanding Event Details

**Cryptic Descriptions**
- **Context**: Refer to the action type and entity type for clarity
- **Timestamps**: Use timestamps to correlate with your actions
- **Status**: Check success/failure status for troubleshooting

**Multiple Similar Events**
- **Batch Operations**: Some actions may generate multiple audit events
- **Retry Logic**: Failed actions may create multiple entries
- **User Actions**: Rapid successive actions will all be logged
