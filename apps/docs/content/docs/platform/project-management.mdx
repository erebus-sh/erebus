# Project Management

Projects are the foundational organizational unit in Erebus platform. Each project provides an isolated environment for your real-time applications with dedicated API keys, analytics, audit logs, and configuration settings.

## Project Overview

### What is a Project?

A project in Erebus represents a single real-time application or service. Each project includes:

- **Isolated Environment**: Separate namespace for channels, users, and data
- **Dedicated API Keys**: Independent authentication and access control
- **Individual Analytics**: Project-specific metrics and usage tracking
- **Separate Audit Logs**: Security and activity logging per project
- **Custom Configuration**: Project-specific settings and integrations

*[Screenshot placeholder: Projects dashboard showing multiple projects]*

### Project Limits

- **Maximum Projects**: 50 projects per account
- **Project Names**: 3-100 characters, customizable at any time
- **API Keys**: Unlimited API keys per project
- **Regional Deployment**: Global (auto-region) and EU options

## Creating Projects

### Project Creation Process

*[Screenshot placeholder: Create project dialog with form fields]*

1. **Navigate to Projects**: Go to your account dashboard
2. **Click "Create new project"**: Opens the project creation dialog
3. **Enter Project Details**:
   - **Project Title**: Descriptive name (3-100 characters)
   - **Region Selection**: Choose deployment region
4. **Click "Create Project"**: Project is created instantly

### Region Selection

**Global Region (Recommended)**

### Webhook Configuration

*[Screenshot placeholder: Webhook URL configuration interface]*

Webhooks enable you to forward real-time messages to your backend services for processing, storage, or integration with other systems.

#### Webhook Setup

**URL Requirements**
- **Protocol**: Must use HTTPS for security
- **Format**: Base URL only (e.g., `https://api.yourapp.com`)
- **No Paths**: System automatically appends `/erebus/webhook`
- **Validation**: Real-time URL format validation

**Configuration Process**
1. Enter your base HTTPS URL in the webhook field
2. System validates URL format automatically
3. Click "Update Webhook URL" to save
4. Webhooks become active immediately

#### Webhook Validation Rules

The system enforces strict validation:

**Valid Examples**
- `https://api.myapp.com`
- `https://webhooks.example.org`
- `https://myservice.herokuapp.com`

**Invalid Examples**
- `http://api.myapp.com` (HTTP not allowed)
- `https://api.myapp.com/erebus` (paths not allowed)
- `api.myapp.com` (protocol missing)

<Callout title="Webhook Security" type="warning">
Webhook URLs must use HTTPS to ensure message security during transmission. The system automatically validates URLs and prevents configuration of insecure endpoints.
</Callout>

#### Message Forwarding

**Forwarded Data Structure**
```json
{
  "projectId": "proj_01HQXYZ456ABC789",
  "channel": "chat:general",
  "message": {
    "id": "msg_01HQXYZ123ABC456",
    "payload": "Hello, world!",
    "timestamp": 1699123456789,
    "userId": "user_01HQXYZ789DEF123"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "origin": "erebus-platform",
    "version": "1.0"
  }
}
```

**Delivery Guarantees**
- **At-least-once delivery**: Messages are delivered reliably
- **Retry logic**: Failed deliveries are automatically retried
- **Timeout handling**: Configurable timeout for webhook endpoints
- **Error logging**: Delivery failures are logged for debugging

### Advanced Settings

**Project Status Management**
- **Active**: Normal operation with full functionality
- **Archived**: Read-only access, no new connections allowed
- **Maintenance**: Temporary operational restrictions

**Performance Configuration**
- **Connection limits**: Per-project connection quotas
- **Rate limiting**: Message throughput controls
- **Channel restrictions**: Namespace-based access controls

## Project Organization

### Multi-Project Strategies

**Environment Separation**
```
my-app-development

## Project Deletion

### Deletion Restrictions

*[Screenshot placeholder: Project deletion dialog with restrictions]*

Projects cannot be deleted if they contain:

**Usage Data**
- Historical analytics data
- Message logs or history
- Connection records
- Performance metrics

**Active Resources**
- Active API keys
- Webhook configurations
- Active subscriptions
- Real-time connections

### Safe Deletion Process

**Pre-Deletion Steps**
1. **Revoke all API keys**: Ensure no active authentication
2. **Disconnect all clients**: Terminate active connections
3. **Clear webhooks**: Remove integration endpoints
4. **Export data**: Download any required audit logs or analytics

**Deletion Confirmation**
- **Double confirmation**: Multiple confirmation steps required
- **Impact warning**: Clear explanation of what will be lost
- **Audit logging**: Deletion attempts are logged even if unsuccessful

<Callout title="Data Retention" type="warning">
Project deletion is permanent and irreversible. All associated data, including API keys, analytics, and audit logs, will be permanently lost. Ensure you have exported any required data before proceeding.
</Callout>
