# Welcome to Erebus (Beta)
<Callout title="Beta version" type="warning">
Erebus is in beta. The SDK APIs might change and are not guaranteed to be backward compatible with every update.  
You are welcome to try Erebus in side projects and share feedback.  
If the docs do not cover what you need, help can be provided directly. Reach out at [x.com/v0id_user](https://x.com/v0id_user).

Erebus is an early-stage real-time infrastructure platform. At this stage you get one core primitive with two behaviors built in:

- **Pub/Sub Channels** — publish and subscribe to ordered messages using ULID sequences so delivery order is guaranteed.  
- **Presence** — presence events are part of channels. When clients connect and subscribe to a room, presence state is updated automatically and fired out to everyone in that channel.  
- **Acknowledgments** — an MQTT-style ack system with QoS 1 support. Every message is delivered at least once and acknowledged by subscribers.  

That is the foundation. One channel gives you both messaging and awareness of who is in the room.  

When you connect, you are placed in the nearest point of presence (PoP). Everyone in that region shares the same local channel object, so ordering and presence are consistent without global lag.

## What is inside the docs

- **Setup** – Managed beta or self host locally.  
- **Concepts** – Channels, ordering, presence, and tokens.  
- **SDK Guide** – Use `useChannel` in your React app.  
- **Reference** – API and SDK calls.

> **Status**: Beta. Channels with ordered messages and built-in presence are live. More primitives will grow from here.
