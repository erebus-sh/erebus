# Welcome to Erebus

Erebus is a **real‑time infrastructure platform**. We give you the building blocks to power messaging, presence, and sync at scale — without forcing you to reinvent low‑latency infra.

You choose how to run it:
- **Managed Service** — fully hosted, with usage‑based pricing and a generous free tier.
- **Self‑Host** — run it yourself with Docker or deploy directly to your infra.

---

## What You’ll Find in the Docs

- **Introduction** – What Erebus is, why it exists, and how it compares to alternatives.
- **Installation / Setup** – Step‑by‑step for both managed service and self‑host setups.
- **Core Concepts** – Channels, messages, ordering (ULIDs), presence, and authentication with grant tokens.
- **SDK Guides** – Using the Erebus SDK in Next.js and React, with typed hooks like `useChannel`.
- **Advanced Primitives** – Working directly with the low‑level APIs.
- **Reference** – Full API and SDK reference.
- **Contribution Guide** – How to contribute or extend Erebus.

> **Status**: MVP live — real‑time infra that just works. Iterate fast, scale later.

### Why This Matters

1. **Choice** — managed hosting or total control via self‑hosting.
2. **Primitives** — not just an opinionated layer; real building blocks.
3. **DX first** — type‑safe SDKs, clean APIs, and fast iteration.
