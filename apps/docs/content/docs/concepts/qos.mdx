# Quality of Service

Erebus provides configurable **Quality of Service (QoS)** levels for message delivery, inspired by MQTT.  
QoS defines how reliable a message transfer should be, and what guarantees the system provides when clients publish and receive data.

Currently, Erebus supports **QoS 0** and **QoS 1**.  

# Quality of Service levels

## QoS 0 – *At most once*

Messages are sent **without any delivery guarantee**.  
The server does not acknowledge receipt, and the client will not retry if the message is lost in transit.

This mode is best for:
- Ephemeral updates (e.g. presence pings, typing indicators)
- Scenarios where **low latency** is more important than guaranteed delivery

In short: *fire and forget.*

## QoS 1 – *At least once*

Messages are sent and retried until the **server acknowledges** that they’ve been received.  
This guarantees that the message reaches Erebus at least once, but **duplicates may occur** if the sender retransmits before receiving the ACK.

Erebus uses **ULID-based sequence IDs** to make deduplication and ordering simple for clients and servers.

This mode is best for:
- Chat messages
- Collaborative edits
- Any event where delivery must be reliable

In short: *guaranteed delivery, with possible duplicates.*

<Callout title="Note:" type="warning">

Erebus does not currently implement QoS 2 (“exactly once”), as the additional handshake adds latency and complexity. For most realtime use cases, QoS 1 combined with deduplication is the right balance of speed and reliability.
