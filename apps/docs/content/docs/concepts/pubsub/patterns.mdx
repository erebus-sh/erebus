# Topics and Patterns

In Erebus, pattern-based subscriptions are still very limited.

For example, subscribing to something like `chat:*` is **not supported yet**.  
The only supported wildcard is `*`, which simply means “subscribe to everything.”

Channels names currently do not support scoped or partial patterns either. This feature is still immature and very much a work-in-progress (WIP).
