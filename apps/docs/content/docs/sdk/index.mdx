# Erebus SDK

The Erebus SDK gives you everything you need to build real-time apps on top of Erebus pub/sub.  
It provides a type-safe and raw **Core Client** and a type-safe **React Client** with hooks for subscription, publishing, and presence.

## Installation

```package-install
@erebus-sh/sdk
```



# Packages
Currently shipped as a single package:
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/client` â€“ low-level client APIs
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/react` â€“ React hooks on top of the core (**Experimental/Unstable**)
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/server` â€“ Server-side SDK for building Erebus servers
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/service` â€“ Helpers for server-side authorization and sessions
But it's also available on:
- `@erebus-sh/sdk` â€“ All packages in one exported in a barrel file (will change in the future)


# Core APIs

The Core Client provides stable, type-safe APIs for interacting with Erebus pub/sub and messaging infrastructure. The main APIs include:

- **connect**: Establishes a connection to the Erebus backend. Handles authentication and connection lifecycle.
- **publish**: Sends messages to a specified channel, namespace, or region.
- **subscribe**: Listens for messages on a channel (or channels), receiving real-time updates.
- **ack**: Acknowledges receipt of a message (if required by your backend or QoS settings).
- **sequences**: Provides access to message sequences and ordering, useful for replay or catch-up.
- **namespaces/regions**: Allows scoping of channels and messages to logical or geographic partitions.

The core APIs are designed for flexibility and reliability, making it easy to build real-time features such as chat, notifications, presence, and collaborative editing.

## Quickstart: Connect, Subscribe, Publish

```ts
import { ErebusClient, ErebusClientState } from '@erebus-sh/sdk/client'

const client = ErebusClient.createClient({
  client: ErebusClientState.PubSub,
  authBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:4919',
  wsBaseUrl: 'ws://localhost:8787',
})

await client.joinChannel('chats')
await client.connect()

await client.subscribe('test_123', (msg) => {
  console.log('Received:', msg.payload, 'from', msg.senderId)
})

await client.onPresence('test_123', (presence) => {
  console.log('Presence:', presence)
})

await client.publishWithAck({
  topic: 'test_123',
  messageBody: 'Hello Erebus ðŸ‘‹',
  onAck: (ack) => {
    console.log('Message acknowledged:', ack.ack)
  },
})
```

> For a full end-to-end example (including a Bun-based auth server using `createGenericAdapter` and webhooks), see the [Core Client APIs](/docs/sdk/core/apis) page.


# React Package (Experimental)

The React package (`@erebus-sh/sdk/react`) is **experimental** and its API will change. It provides React hooks for subscription, publishing, and presence, built on top of the core client.
