# Erebus SDK

The Erebus SDK gives you everything you need to build real-time apps on top of Erebus pub/sub.  
It provides a type-safe and raw **Core Client** and a type-safe **React Client** with hooks for subscription, publishing, and presence.

## Installation

```package-install
@erebus-sh/sdk
```



# Packages
Currently shipped as a single package:
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/client` â€“ low-level client APIs
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/react` â€“ React hooks on top of the core (**Experimental/Unstable**)
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/server` â€“ Server-side SDK for building Erebus servers
- `@erebus-sh/sdk/service` â€“ Helpers for server-side authorization and sessions
But it's also available on:
- `@erebus-sh/sdk` â€“ All packages in one exported in a barrel file (will change in the future)


# Core APIs

The Core Client provides stable, type-safe APIs for interacting with Erebus pub/sub and messaging infrastructure. Key features include:

## Core Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Publish and subscribe to topics with guaranteed message ordering
- **Presence tracking**: Automatic presence events when clients join/leave topics  
- **Message history**: Fetch historical messages with cursor-based pagination
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with schema validation facade
- **Connection management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Acknowledgments**: MQTT-style ACK system with QoS 1 support

## Advanced Capabilities

- **ULID sequences**: Lexicographically sortable message ordering for replay and catch-up
- **Schema facade**: Runtime validation with Zod schemas for type-safe messaging
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery patterns
- **State management**: Connection state monitoring and lifecycle events
- **Flexible subscriptions**: Multiple subscription patterns with options and callbacks

## Documentation Sections

- **[Complete API Reference](/docs/sdk/core/apis)** - All methods, types, and examples
- **[Message History](/docs/sdk/core/history)** - Pagination, cursors, and advanced patterns  
- **[Schema Facade](/docs/sdk/core/schema-facade)** - Type-safe messaging with validation
- **[Quick Reference](/docs/sdk/core/quick-reference)** - Common patterns and cheat sheet

## Quickstart: Connect, Subscribe, Publish

```ts
import { ErebusClient, ErebusClientState } from '@erebus-sh/sdk'

const client = ErebusClient.createClient({
  client: ErebusClientState.PubSub,
  authBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:4919',
  wsBaseUrl: 'ws://localhost:8787',
})

client.joinChannel('chats')
await client.connect()

await client.subscribe('test_123', (msg) => {
  console.log('Received:', msg.payload, 'from', msg.senderId)
})

await client.onPresence('test_123', (presence) => {
  console.log('Presence:', presence)
})

await client.publishWithAck(
  'test_123',
  'Hello Erebus ðŸ‘‹',
  (ack) => {
    console.log('Message acknowledged:', ack.success ? 'Success' : `Failed: ${ack.error?.message}`)
  },
  3000
)
```

> For a full end-to-end example (including a Bun-based auth server using `createGenericAdapter` and webhooks), see the [Core Client APIs](/docs/sdk/core/apis) page.


# React Package (Experimental)

The React package (`@erebus-sh/sdk/react`) is **experimental** and its API will change. It provides React hooks for subscription, publishing, and presence, built on top of the core client.
