# What is this?

Erebus is real-time infrastructure at the edge.
It’s a managed service, not a framework — you don’t stitch together pieces, we give you the building blocks.

Erebus provides simple primitives and abstractions on top of Cloudflare Durable Objects, making it cheap, fast, and globally distributed by default. You focus on building your app; we handle the real-time plumbing.

Built with Bun, TypeScript, and React, Erebus is designed to feel lightweight, modern, and developer-friendly. This is a community-driven project, and it will keep improving as more developers use it, break it, and push it forward.
