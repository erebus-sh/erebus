# What is this?

Erebus is real-time infrastructure at the edge.
It’s a managed service, not a framework — you don’t stitch together pieces, we give you the building blocks.

Erebus provides simple primitives and abstractions on top of Cloudflare Durable Objects, making it cheap, fast, and globally distributed by default. You focus on building your app; we handle the real-time plumbing.

Built with Bun, TypeScript, and React, Erebus is designed to feel lightweight, modern, and developer-friendly. This is a community-driven project, and it will keep improving as more developers use it, break it, and push it forward.

## Why Erebus

Most real-time platforms today fall into one of these problems:

- Too expensive | pricing that makes it hard to even start small.
- Too complex | you don’t really know what’s happening under the hood.
- Too outdated | they don’t fit modern development practices, or expect you to build too much yourself.

Erebus is built to avoid all three.
