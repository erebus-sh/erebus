# Erebus Overview

## ⚡ What is Erebus?
Erebus is a **real-time infrastructure platform** that enables developers to build collaborative, event-driven applications with **edge-native performance**. It abstracts away the complexity of managing WebSockets, message brokers, and sequencing logic, so teams can focus on product logic rather than infra plumbing.

## 🛠 Core Architecture

### Cloudflare Edge Runtime
- Powered by **Durable Objects** and **Workers**.
- Provides low-latency connections and fault-tolerant coordination across regions.

### Convex (Primary Database)
Convex is the **brain and storage layer** of Erebus:
- **Projects & API keys** (authentication, provisioning, quotas).
- **Usage analytics** (event counts, subscription metrics, billing).
- **Persistent storage** (history, pagination, beyond ephemeral streams).
- **Configuration state** (namespaces, presence, client access control).

### Upstash Redis (Supporting Role)
- Handles **ephemeral data**, **rate-limiting**, and **caching**.
- Not the main database — acts as an accelerator and guardrail.

### Ordering & Sequencing
- **Region-local ULIDs** ensure **monotonic, sortable IDs**.
- Guarantees ordering per region, and approximate ordering globally without a central bottleneck.

### Developer SDK
- **TypeScript-first** SDK.
- HTTP endpoints for publishing, rewinding history, and querying state.

## 🎯 Why It Matters
Modern apps need real-time features — chat, presence, multiplayer editing, live dashboards.
Instead of stitching together Kafka, Redis, Postgres, and WebSocket servers, Erebus gives developers **one unified platform** with:
- **Reliable real-time channels**
- **History + rewind**
- **Presence tracking**
- **Built-in usage metering**
- **API key management**

---

## 🌐 Positioning
- **Indie developers**: Add presence or channels in minutes.

💡 **In short:** Convex is the control plane and data backbone, Cloudflare is the distributed runtime muscle, and Redis is the sidekick accelerator. Together, Erebus delivers **real-time infra with first-class developer experience.**
